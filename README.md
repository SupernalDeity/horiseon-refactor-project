## Description
01-html-git-css

For this project I changedt HTML semantic elements to help better distinct different sections of code. I also combined a lot of repeating code in the stylesheet to make it cleaner and easier to read. As well as leaving deteailed comments on my changeds for others to easily distinguish what I had worked on.
